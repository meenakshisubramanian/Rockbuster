# Rockbuster Stealth SQL Analysis

Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of Rockbuster Stealth's business data, aimed at answering key strategic questions posed by the management board for their 2020 company strategy. The analysis focuses on identifying which movies contributed most or least to revenue, average rental durations, customer geographical distribution, lifetime value hotspots, and sales variation across regions. Using SQL, the data is queried and analyzed to provide data-driven insights. The results are visualized to present clear, actionable information to Rockbuster management. This project not only showcases SQL skills but also highlights the ability to solve complex business problems applicable across various industries.
